1) Create table
	use this option to create tables to store your data, make sure to follow the same naming convention mentioned above

4) Insert into table
	use this option to insert records into your existing tables ie: table must exist before inserting records into it
	first, you need to specify which column to insert into,
	input a number representing how many columns you want to insert into n where ( 1 < n < total number of columns)
	next you need to input the numbers of the columns you want to insert into in a string separated by spaces
	make sure you don't put any special characters or letters in this string, make sure to specify (1) your primary key
	column in your input string
	following that you should start inserting data in your columns one by one as the prompt asks for it
	remember to take column data type into consideration and that primary key (column1) doesn't accept duplicate values
5) Select from table

		1) this option displays the entire table
		2) this option allows user to input specifc column numbers to display, make sure to follow the same convention mentioned above

7) Update table
	use this option to update specific records or multiple records sharing the same key word in a specific column, you need to enter
	a key word and a column for the search engine to look for that key word in, then input the new value you want to update to, make
	sure to take data type of column into consideration and to make sure you never input duplicate data into primary key column
